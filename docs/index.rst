Documentation for kailo-beewell-dashboard
=========================================

**kailo-beewell-dashboard** is a Python package with functions that are used in
the creation of the various #BeeWell survey dashboards for Kailo. They have
been compiled into a single package to prevent code duplication between the
different repositories.

This site contains guides to some of the key processes for set-up and
maintenance of the dashboard, as well as the automatically generated
documentation for each of the modules and functions.
